sample frogger game
===============================

This game makes use of the following files:

* readme.md (this file)
* index.html (open this file in your browser)
* css/style.css 
* images folder contents
* js/app.js (the main code file)
* js/engine.js (the game engine provided for project)
* js/resources.js (image loading utility provided for project)


WHAT IS IT:

This is a simple javascript frogger-imitation game. A game engine loop and image loading utility have been provided (see `js/engine.js` and `js/resources.js`). The code found in `index.html` and `js/app.js` is the code to modify for variations on the game.

TO PLAY:

To run the game in your browser, please open index.html in your favorite browser. Make your selections, and play the game.

TO EDIT:

You can change characters, speeds, levels, items, and other parts of the game. 

- The `index.html` file has the code for the beginning selection screen. 
- Most of the app logic is in `js/app.js`, and the images should be placed in the images folders (and references to images updated). 
- To change colors or the font, take a look at `css/style.css`
